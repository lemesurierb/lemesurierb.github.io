<h1>Brenton leMesurier, College of Charleston</h1>

<h3>Last Revised on December 14, 2022</h3>

<h2>Some free "books"</h2>

<p>I am gathering free materials that I have created for various courses that I often teach,
using either the
<a href="https://pretextbook.org/">PreTeXt</a>
or
<a href="https://jupyterbook.org/">Jupyter Book</a>
authoring systems, each of which can produce both web-site (HTML )and printable (PDF) versions,
though the former have distinct advnatages for interactivity and such.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="./introduction-to-numerical-methods-and-analysis-julia/index.html">Introduction to Numerical Methods and Analysis with Julia (draft)</a>;
a <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/">Jupyter Book</a> derived from material for the College of Charleston courses
MATH 245 <em>Numerical Methods and Mathematical Computing</em>
and its adjunct computer lab course MATH 246,
but converted to using the Julia language.
This is a work-in-progress: it is being expanded to cover additional topics, in particular methods for ordinary differential equations,
and to add futher analysis of methods.
<br>
It contains a brief introduction to the Julia language, addressed to those already somewhat familiar with either Matlab or Python,
and also aspires to teach Julia programming "on the fly", with numerous comments on its idioms throughout the text.
<br>
This is also available in a somewhat rougher <a href="./introduction-to-numerical-methods-and-analysis-julia.pdf">PDF</a> version.
</li>
<li><a href="./introduction-to-numerical-methods-and-analysis-python/index.html">Introduction to Numerical Methods and Analysis with Python (draft)</a>;
A sibling of the above Julia version, using Python instead.
<br>
Again, this is also available in a somewhat rougher <a href="./introduction-to-numerical-methods-and-analysis-python.pdf">PDF</a> version.
</li>
</ul>
