This is a collection of free materials that I have created for various courses that I often teach,
using either the [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org/) or [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/)
authoring systems, each of which can produce both web-site (HTML )and printable (PDF) versions,
though the former have distinct advantages for interactivity and such.

For now there is just one work-in-progress, *Introduction to Numerical Methods and Analysis with Julia*.
